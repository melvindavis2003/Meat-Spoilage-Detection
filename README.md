# Meat-Spoilage-Detection
 This project aims to develop a **Meat Spoilage Detection System** that accurately estimates the spoilage level of chicken samples. The system leverages pH and ammonia values to analyze the spoilage factor. Notably, the detection is contactless, with the system designed to read ammonia values emitted into the air from the meat sample.
